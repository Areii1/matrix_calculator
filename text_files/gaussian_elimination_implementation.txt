------------------------------ GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION -----------------------------------

- it receives a matrix and outputs the row equivilent version of the same matrix it
echelon form.


- first it needs to detect rows with leading zero's
		- swap the rows in an ascending order by the amount of leading zero's
				- least leading zero's row at the top, most leading zero's at the bottom.

- second it needs to terminate every value below the first leading non-zero value of the first row
	- same thing for the first leading non-zero value of the second row
		- continue until every leading non-zero value of any row does not have any non-zero
			values below them.
