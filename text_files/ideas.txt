TO be implemented on the calculator:

- delete matrix from file by name

- error handling:
	- user input is of invalid type (not int) AT any stage
	- user input is of invalid range





































- have the program recognize and execute statements like (A * B) written as input to scanf

- solve linear systems in the form of Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, 
	x is vector of unknowns (x, y, z) and b is a vector of constants.
	
		- by solving we mean applying the gaussian elimination method, and getting the matrix into 
			row canonical form. From which one can extract the answer of the linear system.

FLOW OF THE PROGRAM:

- user is asked to provide a matrix or give a statement, (choice 1 or choice 2).

1 --->	- user is asked to provide a coefficient matrix, unknown vector or a constant vector. (1, 2 or 3)
					- user is asked to provide a name for the matrix.				
						- user is asked to provide the measures for the matrix.
							- user is asked to provide the elements of the matrix, (within the bounds of the given measures).
								- program saves the given information on a file.


2 --->	 - the program loads the given matrix or matrices and recognized what operations needs to be done
					- if the operation produces a new matrix, the user is asked to provide a name for that matrix.	
						- the statement is executed, printed and results are saved.


- also the user can write help, which brings up a list of commands and descriptions of things that can be done
	- for example print every matrix available on the storage
		- or change the MAX_ROWS, MAX_COLUMNS




ADDITIONAL IDEAS:

- make tests to check the validity of certain operations



DONE already: 

- Be able to save and load matrices by name, to/from a file.

- print matrix from file by name
